# Sparklers
[Live](https://zaesur.github.io/sparklers)

## Description
My submission for a challenge themed around fireworks, hosted at work.

The goal of this project has been to recreate the feeling of moving around a sparkler and observing the trail it leaves.

I've started off with Bruno Simons excellent shader tutorials, and tried to recreate the sparks this way.
I've also created an overridden MeshStandardMaterial which simulates the burning sparkler.
